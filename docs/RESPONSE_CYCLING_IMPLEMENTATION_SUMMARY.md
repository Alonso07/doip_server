# Response Cycling Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented response cycling functionality for the DoIP server's UDS message processing. The system now cycles through different responses for the same UDS service, providing more realistic testing scenarios where the same service can return different responses.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Response Cycling State Management

#### Instance Variable
- **`response_cycle_state`**: Dictionary tracking current response index for each ECU-service combination
- **Format**: `{(ecu_address, service_name): current_index}`
- **Initialization**: Empty dictionary created in `__init__` method

#### Key Features
- **Per-ECU Service Tracking**: Each ECU-service combination has independent cycling state
- **Automatic Cycling**: When reaching the end of responses, automatically cycles back to first response
- **Memory Efficient**: Only stores state for services that have been accessed

### 2. Updated `process_uds_message` Method

#### Enhanced Logic
```python
# Get current response index for this service-ECU combination
current_index = self.response_cycle_state.get(cycle_key, 0)

# Select response based on current index
response_hex = responses[current_index]

# Update index for next time (cycle back to 0 when reaching end)
next_index = (current_index + 1) % len(responses)
self.response_cycle_state[cycle_key] = next_index
```

#### Key Features
- **Cycling Logic**: Uses modulo arithmetic to cycle through responses
- **Logging**: Enhanced logging shows current response number and next index
- **Error Handling**: Maintains existing error handling for invalid responses
- **Backward Compatibility**: Works with both hierarchical and legacy configurations

### 3. Reset Functionality

#### `reset_response_cycling` Method
- **Reset All**: `reset_response_cycling()` - clears all cycling states
- **Reset Specific ECU-Service**: `reset_response_cycling(ecu_address, service_name)`
- **Reset by ECU**: `reset_response_cycling(ecu_address=0x1000)` - resets all services for ECU
- **Reset by Service**: `reset_response_cycling(service_name="Read_VIN")` - resets service for all ECUs

#### `get_response_cycling_state` Method
- **Debug Support**: Returns readable format of current cycling states
- **Format**: `{"ECU_0x1000_Read_VIN": 1, "ECU_0x1001_Read_VIN": 0}`
- **Use Case**: Debugging and monitoring response cycling behavior

### 4. Configuration Support

#### Hierarchical Configuration
- **ECU-Specific Cycling**: Each ECU has independent cycling state
- **Service Isolation**: Different services on same ECU have independent cycling
- **Key Format**: `(target_address, service_name)`

#### Legacy Configuration
- **Global Cycling**: Single cycling state for all services
- **ECU Address**: Uses 0x0000 as default ECU address for legacy mode
- **Key Format**: `(0x0000, service_name)`

## Test Results

### âœ… **All Tests Passing: 9/9**

#### Test Coverage
1. **Initialization Test**: Verifies response cycling state is properly initialized
2. **Hierarchical Config Test**: Tests cycling with hierarchical configuration
3. **Different ECUs Test**: Verifies independent cycling states per ECU
4. **Different Services Test**: Verifies independent cycling states per service
5. **Three Responses Test**: Tests cycling with services having 3+ responses
6. **Reset Functionality Test**: Tests reset methods for specific and all states
7. **Legacy Config Test**: Tests cycling with legacy configuration
8. **Single Response Test**: Tests behavior with services having only one response

### ðŸ“Š **Demo Results**

The demo script successfully demonstrates:
- âœ… **Response Cycling**: Different responses returned for same service calls
- âœ… **ECU Independence**: Each ECU cycles independently
- âœ… **Service Independence**: Each service cycles independently
- âœ… **Reset Functionality**: Cycling states can be reset and restart from beginning
- âœ… **Multiple Response Counts**: Works with 2, 3, or more responses per service
- âœ… **Legacy Support**: Works with both hierarchical and legacy configurations

## Example Usage

### Basic Response Cycling
```python
# Create server
server = DoIPServer(gateway_config_path="config/gateway1.yaml")

# First call to Read_VIN for Engine ECU
response1 = server.process_uds_message(bytes.fromhex("22F190"), 0x1000)
# Returns: 62F1901020011223344556677889AABB (first response)

# Second call to same service
response2 = server.process_uds_message(bytes.fromhex("22F190"), 0x1000)
# Returns: 62F1901020011223344556677889BBCC (second response)

# Third call cycles back to first response
response3 = server.process_uds_message(bytes.fromhex("22F190"), 0x1000)
# Returns: 62F1901020011223344556677889AABB (first response again)
```

### Reset Functionality
```python
# Reset specific ECU-service combination
server.reset_response_cycling(0x1000, "Read_VIN")

# Reset all cycling states
server.reset_response_cycling()

# Get current cycling state
state = server.get_response_cycling_state()
print(state)  # {"ECU_0x1000_Read_VIN": 1, "ECU_0x1001_Read_VIN": 0}
```

## Configuration Examples

      - "0x62F1901020011223344556677889AABB"  # Response 1
      - "0x62F1901020011223344556677889BBCC"  # Response 2

engine_services:
  Engine_RPM_Read:
    request: "0x220C01"
    responses:
      - "0x620C018000"  # 8000 RPM
      - "0x620C017500"  # 7500 RPM
